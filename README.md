# Telangana Tourism Analysis
This is a project organized by Cosebasics. This project has helped me built my Power BI skills even more. 

Problem Statement - Telangana is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy. As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.

Tools & Approach - Power BI, Python, Canva & Microsoft Excel

Findings & Suggestions - 
- Telangana State tourism development corporation's services are not upto the mark.
- Hyderabad intake of domestic visitors has been drastically reducing.
- States like Mulugu, Warangal (Rural), Mancherial, Hyderabad are the states with high potential of growth.
- Govt. should make sure the tourism packages provided are worth and legally approved.
- Organise cultural events specifically in the months of December, January, February, June
- A better traffic management would do wonders
